# Custom C-Based Compiler

My compiler is made to implement a programming language that I have decided to call ***C--*** (C minus minus). This is due to the fact that this language lacks many of the features of **C**, but I plan to continue adding more functionality to the language as time goes on (and even possibly experiment with new features like custom memory models for pointers/integers).

The compilation process generally follows these steps:
### 1. Tokenization (Lexing)
### 2. Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
### 3. Conversion to an Intermediate Representation (IR)
### 4. Optimization (eventually)
### 5. Assembly code generation
